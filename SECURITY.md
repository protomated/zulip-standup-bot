## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these guidelines:

### Where to Report

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities by:

1. **Email**: Send details to security@your-domain.com
2. **Private GitHub Security Advisory**: Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting
3. **Encrypted Communication**: Use our PGP key if you prefer encrypted communication

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:

- **Description**: A clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: What an attacker could achieve by exploiting this vulnerability
- **Reproduction Steps**: Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- **Environment**: Version numbers, operating system, deployment method
- **Proof of Concept**: Code or screenshots demonstrating the vulnerability (if applicable)
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for how to fix the issue

### Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: We will provide an initial assessment within 5 business days
- **Regular Updates**: We will provide updates every 5 business days until resolution
- **Resolution**: We aim to resolve critical vulnerabilities within 30 days

### Disclosure Policy

- We follow responsible disclosure practices
- We will coordinate with you on disclosure timing
- We will credit you in security advisories (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)
- We request that you do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until we have released a fix

## Security Measures

### Bot Security

The Zulip Standup Bot implements several security measures:

#### Authentication & Authorization
- **API Key Security**: Bot uses secure API key authentication with Zulip
- **Scope Limitation**: Bot only requests necessary permissions
- **Channel Permissions**: Respects Zulip's channel access controls
- **Admin Commands**: Administrative commands require appropriate permissions

#### Data Protection
- **Minimal Data Storage**: Only stores necessary standup data
- **Data Encryption**: Sensitive data encrypted in transit and at rest
- **Data Retention**: Automatic cleanup of old data (configurable)
- **No PII Collection**: Avoids collecting unnecessary personal information

#### Input Validation
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Uses parameterized queries
- **Command Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse through command rate limiting
- **Error Handling**: Secure error handling prevents information disclosure

#### Network Security
- **HTTPS Only**: All external communications use HTTPS
- **Certificate Validation**: Validates SSL certificates
- **Timeout Handling**: Proper timeout handling prevents resource exhaustion
- **Connection Pooling**: Secure database connection management

### Database Security

#### PostgreSQL Security
- **Authentication**: Strong authentication required
- **Encryption**: Connections encrypted with TLS
- **Access Control**: Database-level access controls
- **Backup Security**: Encrypted backups with secure storage

#### SQLite Security
- **File Permissions**: Proper file system permissions
- **WAL Mode**: Uses WAL mode for better concurrency and reliability
- **Path Validation**: Validates database file paths

### Deployment Security

#### Docker Security
- **Non-root User**: Containers run as non-root user
- **Minimal Base Images**: Uses minimal Alpine Linux base images
- **Security Updates**: Regular base image updates
- **Secret Management**: Secure handling of environment variables

#### Environment Security
- **Secret Management**: Environment variables for sensitive data
- **Configuration Validation**: Validates all configuration at startup
- **Log Security**: Prevents logging of sensitive information
- **Health Checks**: Regular health monitoring

## Common Security Considerations

### API Keys
- **Storage**: Never commit API keys to version control
- **Rotation**: Regularly rotate API keys
- **Scope**: Use minimal necessary permissions
- **Monitoring**: Monitor API key usage for anomalies

### Database Access
- **Credentials**: Use strong, unique database credentials
- **Network**: Restrict database network access
- **Backups**: Secure backup storage and encryption
- **Monitoring**: Monitor database access and performance

### Deployment
- **Updates**: Keep all dependencies up to date
- **Monitoring**: Monitor for security vulnerabilities
- **Access Control**: Limit deployment access to authorized personnel
- **Logging**: Maintain security logs for audit purposes

## Security Best Practices for Users

### Bot Setup
1. **Dedicated Bot Account**: Create a dedicated Zulip bot account
2. **Minimal Permissions**: Grant only necessary permissions
3. **Regular Audits**: Regularly audit bot permissions and access
4. **Monitor Activity**: Monitor bot activity for anomalies

### Environment Security
1. **Secure Hosting**: Use secure, updated hosting environment
2. **Network Security**: Implement proper network security measures
3. **Access Control**: Limit access to bot configuration and data
4. **Regular Updates**: Keep bot and dependencies updated

### Configuration Security
1. **Strong Passwords**: Use strong database passwords
2. **Environment Variables**: Use environment variables for secrets
3. **Configuration Review**: Regularly review configuration
4. **Backup Security**: Secure backup procedures

## Known Security Considerations

### Limitations
- **Message Privacy**: Bot can read all messages in channels where it's added
- **Data Persistence**: Standup data is stored persistently (with configurable retention)
- **AI Integration**: When enabled, standup summaries are sent to third-party AI services

### Recommendations
- **Channel Scope**: Only add bot to channels where standup functionality is needed
- **Data Retention**: Configure appropriate data retention policies
- **AI Privacy**: Review AI service privacy policies if using AI summaries
- **Regular Audits**: Conduct regular security audits
